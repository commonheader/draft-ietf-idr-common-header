                 BGP Community Common Header Attribute
                    draft-hares-idr-common-header-00

Abstract

   The original BGP community attribute as defined by [RFC1997] has
   enjoyed widespread usage.  As BGP has evolved, the need for several
   different styles of communities (or "route colors") emerged.  This
   document defines a new BGP attribute that can aggregates all new
   styles of communities behind a single BGP Path attribute.  The
   community styles contained by this attribute are to be defined in
   separate documents.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   As BGP has evolved, various use cases have presented themselves for
   various flavors of coloring routes.  This document defines a new BGP
   attribute that can aggregate all the new styles of route coloring.
   The community styles contained by this attribute are to be defined in
   separate documents.

2.  BGP Common Community Header Attribute

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the BGP Common
   Community Header Attribute.  The attribute type code is (TBA by
   IANA).

   The BGP Common Community Header Attribute is an optional, transitive
   BGP attribute.  The attribute may be present multiple times in a BGP
   UPDATE message with the unique constraint of the tuple (type, global
   administrator).

   The attribute is followed by a number of typed communities.  Any
   given community type may appear multiple times.

Internet-Draft                Common Header               September 2016


2.1.  BGP Community Common Header

   Communities always start with the following header:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Type               |          Length               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Global Administrator                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are as shown below:

        Type -  The type of community following the header.  The types
             are to be defined in companion documents.  This is a two
             octet field.

        Length -  The number of octets occupied by this header and the
             communities under it.  This is a two octet field.

        Global Administrator -  This sub-field contains a 4-octet
             Autonomous System number assigned by IANA.

   A BGP speaker that does not recognize a community type SHOULD ignore
   it, but propagate it to other speakers.  This behavior MAY be
   overridden by local policy.

3.  Error Handling

   An implementation should walk all Common Headers and verify that all
   of the communities fill up the path attribute length.  If this is not
   the case, the update message should be treated as withdrawn.  Further
   procedures are described in [RFC7606].

4.  Security Considerations

   Optional transitive transitive BGP attributes could unintentionally
   spread far from their origin.  XX insert further deployment.

5.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation

   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Community:

   o  ExaBGP

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BPG path attribute code for the BGP
   Community Common Header Attribute.

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry of community
   types for the Type field.

   Name                       Type Value      Transitivity
   ----                       ----------      ------------
   Reserved                   0x0000          n/a
   IETF Consensus             0x0001-0x02AA   Transitive
   IETF Consensus             0x02AB-0x0555   Non-Transitive
   First come First served    0x0556-0x07FF   Transitive
